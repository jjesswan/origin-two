### Premise:
My game is called “Origin Two (O2)”, a metroidvania style adventure game that follows a lone astronaut 
who must protect the last living plant and give life to the dying post-apocalyptic planet that was destroyed by humans. 
The game will have exploratory regions that vary in oxygen and radiation levels, and checkpoints 
where player is able to feed the plant’s spores to withered trees in order to create safe oxygen 
regions as safety regions.

### How To Play:
1. Run Main.java in package /o2
2. WASD for left/right
3. Click and point with mouse to attack
4. "F" to activate cutscene at tree, when plant charge is full
5. "G" to grab items to use in inventory
