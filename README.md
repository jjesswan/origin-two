### Premise:
My game is called “Origin Two (O2)”, a metroidvania style adventure game that follows a lone astronaut 
who must protect the last living plant and give life to the dying post-apocalyptic planet that was destroyed by humans. 
The game will have exploratory regions that vary in oxygen and radiation levels, and checkpoints 
where player is able to feed the plant’s spores to withered trees in order to create safe oxygen 
regions as safety regions.

### How To Play:
1. Run Main.java in package /o2
2. WASD for left/right
3. Click and point with mouse to attack
4. "F" to activate cutscene at tree, when plant charge is full
5. "G" to grab items to use in inventory

### Engine Features:
1. Text sequences (5 pts)
2. UI Transitions (fade, slide) (5 pts)
3. Inventory System (5 pts)
4. Media/cutscene support (5 pts)
5. Polished UI System


### Cumulative Playtests:

1. Risa --> feedback on controls (was as intuitive as I could explain - WASD, jump space), smoothness, speed of text display (was scrolling too slow, and text chunks were too large and hard to read all at once)
2. Kiera --> pointed out that jump is a little too slow because it goes too high
3. Emily --> cutscene is a little off in terms of color, also dialogue is a bit confusing / too fast
4. Edna --> Player kept falling through ground. I made some bug fixes to collision system tick afterwards.
5. Grace --> (Not used to using trackpad), was difficult to aim at enemies with trackpad, since they were small
6. Jerry --> Sometimes need to press spacebar multiple times to jump up, which was confusing
